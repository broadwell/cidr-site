# Workshops @ CIDR

Every quarter during the academic year, CIDR offers hands-on workshops on tools and methods for data science and digital scholarship. We regularly hold introductory and intermediate workshops on Python and R, along with workshops on basic machine learning methods and data visualization. Our workshops are designed for humanities and social science scholars, using examples from those fields.
