The **Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR)** – part of **Research Data Services** in **Stanford Library** – is a team of humanists and social scientists who collaborate with scholars at all stages to provide **instruction**, **consulting**, and **development support** for data science and digital scholarship. Whether you need help figuring out how to frame your research question into something you can use digital methods to answer, or aren’t sure where to find data for your project, or need a hand with a particularly tricky piece of analysis or visualization code, CIDR can help you overcome the barriers to doing data science and digital scholarship.

For faculty, CIDR runs a program that connects projects with developers for a period of intensive work and close collaboration, in order to develop field-changing new tools and digital resources. Read more about our **developer program**, which has a rolling deadline for applications.

The **Software & Services for Data Science** program and lab (on the first floor of Green Library) offer training and consulting around the acquisition, curation, and preservation of social science data and the selection and use of quantitative (statistical) and qualitative analysis software.

CIDR is the home of the long-running **Academic Technology Specialist program**, a partnership between the library and an academic department. The ATS program provides departments with an embedded staff member with deep technical expertise as well as an academic background in the field. Faculty and students in **Anthropology**, **CESTA**, **DLCL**, and **History** can reach out directly to their ATS staff person for consultation and hands-on assistance.
