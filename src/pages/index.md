The Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR) – part of [Research Data Services in Stanford Library](https://library.stanford.edu/research-data-services) – is a team of humanists and social scientists who collaborate with scholars at all stages to provide [instruction](workshops/), [consulting](consulting/), and [development support](developers/) for data science and digital scholarship. Whether you need help framing your research question into a form you can use digital methods to answer, or aren’t sure where to find data for your project, or need a hand with a particularly tricky piece of analysis or visualization code, CIDR can help you overcome the barriers to doing data science and digital scholarship.

CIDR leads the library’s efforts to curate and make accessible its sizeable humanities and social science datasets. In collaboration with bibliographers, CIDR’s [Research Data Curator](data/) accessions new data acquisitions into the collection. Our goal is to make library data collections FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). To that end, CIDR manages [Data Farm](https://redivis.com/stanford), Stanford's exploration tool for research datasets. Powered by Redivis, Data Farm allows for fast and highly efficient data queries and extractions handled directly in the browser.

For faculty, CIDR runs a program that connects projects with developers for a period of intensive work and close collaboration, in order to develop field-changing new tools and digital resources. Read more about our [developer program](developers/), which has a rolling deadline for applications.

CIDR provides [embedded research support](ats-program/), through a partnership between the library and academic departments, divisions, and research groups. This program provides departments with an embedded staff member with deep technical expertise as well as an academic background in the field. Faculty and students in [Anthropology](https://anthropology.stanford.edu/), [CESTA](https://cesta.stanford.edu/), [DLCL](https://dlcl.stanford.edu/), and [History](https://history.stanford.edu/) can reach out directly to their embedded staff person for consultation and hands-on assistance.

[Software and Services for Data Science](https://ssds.stanford.edu) (in the Velma Denning Room, 120F, first floor, Green Library) is CIDR’s sibling organization that offers training and consulting around the selection and use of quantitative (statistical) software, data science, and the [Text Analysis and Machine Learning Working Group](https://library.stanford.edu/research/software-and-services-data-science/text-analysis-and-machine-learning-working-group-taml).
