# Developers @ CIDR

The CIDR developer team supports scholarship through one-off assistance with specific, small-scale technical tasks, through teaching **workshops** and participating in **consulting**, and through year-long collaborations with faculty on development projects. These long-term development projects ideally go beyond advancing the research in question, by extending the infrastructure of the digital humanities and computational social sciences more generally.

A development project typically consists of approximately four intervals of concentrated work, or “sprints”, run consecutively or separated by dormant periods as the participants' schedules require. Early sprints tend to involve data preparation, technology prototyping and interface design, followed by iterative implementation of the core analytical and interface components, while later sprints focus on deploying and publicizing results, archiving key outputs, and eventual transfer of the completed project materials to the faculty investigators.

Brief Statements of Interest (around 1 page) are accepted and reviewed by the CIDR team on a rolling basis, within one month of receipt. The CIDR team is available for consultation with faculty proponents in order to make early-stage assessments of project scope, fitness for the CIDR developer skill set and overall portfolio, compatibility with technology infrastructures at Stanford, in the libraries, or from third-party sources, and other technical aspects of the project. We encourage faculty members who are interested in working with CIDR to get in touch with us at contact-cidr@stanford.edu for a conversation about goals, needs, and timelines before putting in an application. You can find the instructions for the **most recent CFP in this PDF**.
