# Projects @ CIDR

CIDR staff collaborate with scholars on data science and digital scholarship projects through the [embedded research support (ATS) program](../ats-program/) and the [Developer program](../developers/). Most of our projects have focused on humanities and social science scholarship. Read more about our recent work, or browse through our **project archive**.
