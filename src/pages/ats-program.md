# ATS Program @ CIDR

The Academic Technology Specialist (ATS) program provides a jointly-funded staff position to participating departments. ATSes have an academic background aligned with their partner department, knowledge about the data science / digital scholarship landscape of their field, and deep technical expertise. Being embedded in their partner department gives ATSes an “on-the-ground” view of the needs of the department, allowing them to build long-term working relationships with faculty and students. ATSes often teach methods courses within their departments, and collaborate with scholars in their department on projects and publications.

While the ATS is responsible for addressing the day-to-day needs of their department, they can escalate more technically-complex projects to the **CIDR developers** for one-time assistance with technical challenges, or for consideration as part of the CIDR development program.
