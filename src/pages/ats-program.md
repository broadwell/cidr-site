# Embedded Research Support @ CIDR

The embedded research support program provides a jointly funded staff position to participating departments. These staff (sometimes referred to as “academic technology specialists”) have an academic background aligned with their partner department, knowledge about the data science / digital scholarship landscape of their field, and deep technical expertise. Being embedded in their partner department gives staff an “on-the-ground” view of the needs of the department, allowing them to build long-term working relationships with faculty and students. These staff often teach methods courses within their departments, and collaborate with scholars in their department on projects and publications.

While embedded research support staff are responsible for addressing the day-to-day needs of their department, they can escalate more technically complex projects to the [CIDR developers](developers/) for one-time assistance with technical challenges, or to be considered for adoption as a long-term CIDR development project.
