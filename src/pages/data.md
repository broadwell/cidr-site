# Data @ CIDR

Looking for data for your next research project? Stanford Libraries has purchased or subscribed to a wide arrange of journals, newspapers, and literary data sets – in many cases, allowing scholars to download and work with the full text computationally. Please do not scrape University-licensed resources; we’re happy to help you access the materials you need in a way that doesn’t violate our agreements with publishers.

CIDR oversees the **Data Farm platform** for storing and exploring data sets, and can connect you with other library resources, like books digitized through the Google Books project. Some popular resources include:

* NYT
* WaPo
* [other stuff in Redivis]
