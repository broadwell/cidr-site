    <img src={noh} alt="noh-as-intermedia" />

    led by Professor Jarosław Kapuściński and Senior Lecturer François Rose from the Stanford Department of Music and
    Professor Fujita Takanori from the Kyoto City University of Arts. The completed site presents deep, interactive
    annotations of digitized performances of two exemplary plays, augmented with explanatory texts and multimedia

    <img src={dash} alt="digital-analysis-of-syriac-handwriting" />
    A customizable scriptchart generator developed in collaboration with Professor Michael Penn from the Stanford
    Department of Religious Studies. The generator advances paleographic studies of the Aramaic dialect of Syriac by
    providing a range of options for viewing and comparing letter instances in context, drawing from a corpus of 154
    digitized Syriac manuscripts.
